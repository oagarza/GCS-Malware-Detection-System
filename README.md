# GCS-Malware-Detection-System
This practicum project involved the design and implementation of an advanced Malware Detection System, built on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using advanced cloud services. This system integrates multiple GCP services such as Kubernetes, Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery utilizing Looker Studio, and IAM roles & admin, leveraging a REMnux Linux distribution tailored for malware detection and analysis.

The project's core component is a Kubernetes cluster consisting of three pods and nodes, which orchestrates the deployment and operation of the malware detection tools. The REMnux image, equipped with necessary dependencies, was deployed within this environment. An automated script, "threat_detection.py," was utilized to analyze malware continuously by fetching my data set stored in Google Cloud Storage every 10 seconds.

A notable aspect of my malware system is the use of Suricata, an IDS/IPS tool with predefined rules, to detect and log malicious traffic effectively. This setup was complemented by a daemonset.yaml configuration that automatically scaled the deployment, adding three additional pods equipped with necessary libraries and tools for real time malware analysis and detection.

This system includes automated scripts like "sim_mal.py," designed to simulate malicious HTTP requests to test IDS/IPS functionality. This script interacted with a sandbox testing site, confirming the effectiveness of the Suricata deployment in detecting network trojans through custom HTTP alert rules.

Post detection, the system efficiently handled the logged data by pushing it to Google BigQuery. The use of Looker Studio facilitated the visualization of the collected data, providing clear insights into detected malware, showcasing my malware system's ability to not only detect but also analyze and report on cybersecurity threats in real time.

This Malware Detection System showcases a successful integration of cloud technology with cybersecurity tools to create a highly functional and scalable malware detection environment on the Google Cloud Platform. The project demonstrates significant technical capabilities in handling and analyzing cyber threats, making it a valuable model for future developments in cloud based cybersecurity solutions.
